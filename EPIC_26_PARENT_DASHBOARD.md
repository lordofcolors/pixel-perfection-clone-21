# Epic 26: Parent Dashboard & Learner Management System üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ [0% COMPLETE - FAMILY FOUNDATION]

**Status:** 0% Complete (Planning Phase)
**Prototype Reference:** [Lovable Prototype](https://github.com/lordofcolors/pixel-perfection-clone-21)

**Goal:** To implement a comprehensive Parent/Guardian Dashboard and Learner Management System that establishes family plans as the primary business model, where one parent/guardian pays for and manages multiple learner accounts with shared credit usage and unified billing.

## Business Value
- **Family Plan Priority:** Establish family plans as the primary business model with shared credit pools and single-payer billing
- **14-Day Trial Strategy:** Seamless transition from individual learner trials to family plan adoption  
- **Credit Sharing Economy:** Enable efficient credit usage across all family members under one billing account
- **Educational Oversight:** Provide parent/guardians with comprehensive learner progress monitoring and support tools
- **Flexible Account Transitions:** Support individual learners joining existing family plans or creating new family structures
- **Relationship Building:** Facilitate meaningful parent/guardian-child educational interactions through shared learning visibility

## Core Business Model

### Primary Flow: Family Plans (Target: 80%+ of users)
```
Individual Learner (14-day trial) ‚Üí Family Plan Invitation ‚Üí Shared Credit Pool
```

### Secondary Flow: Standalone Learners (Target: <20% of users)  
```
Individual Learner (14-day trial) ‚Üí Individual Subscription ‚Üí Optional Family Link Later
```

### Key Financial Architecture
- **One Payer Model:** Single parent/guardian manages billing for entire family
- **Shared Credit Pool:** All family members draw from shared credit allocation
- **Trial Transition:** Clear path from individual trials to family plan adoption
- **Flexible Upgrades:** Easy transition from individual to family plans at any time

## Core Account Management Models

Based on the prototype implementation, the system supports two distinct parent/guardian management approaches:

### Model 1: In-House Management
- **Parent/Guardian Role:** Full account control and management
- **Learner Access:** Managed accounts under parent/guardian oversight
- **Use Case:** Younger learners, supervised learning environments
- **Billing:** Single family plan with shared credits
- **Privacy:** Parent/guardian has full visibility into learning progress

### Model 2: Separate Account Monitoring  
- **Parent/Guardian Role:** Oversight and progress monitoring
- **Learner Access:** Independent accounts with parent/guardian visibility
- **Use Case:** Older learners, semi-independent learning
- **Billing:** Parent/guardian pays, learners retain account independence
- **Privacy:** Learners maintain account control with progress sharing
